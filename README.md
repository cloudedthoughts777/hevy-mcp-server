# Hevy MCP Server


A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that connects to the official Hevy API and exposes workout data to AI assistants. Supports dual transport modes: stdio for Claude Desktop and SSE for remote access (e.g., Poke.com).

## Prerequisites

1. **Hevy PRO Subscription** - Required for API access
2. **Hevy API Key** - Get it at https://hevy.com/settings?developer
3. **Node.js** - Version 18 or higher

## Installation

### 1. Clone and Install Dependencies

```bash
git clone https://github.com/meimakes/hevy-mcp-server
cd hevy-mcp-server
npm install
```

### 2. Configure Environment

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` and add your Hevy API key:

```bash
HEVY_API_KEY=your_hevy_api_key_here
HEVY_API_BASE_URL=https://api.hevyapp.com

# Transport configuration
TRANSPORT=stdio                    # stdio | sse | both
PORT=3004                          # Port for SSE/HTTP mode
HOST=127.0.0.1                     # Host for SSE/HTTP mode

# SSE Configuration (for Poke.com)
SSE_PATH=/mcp                      # SSE endpoint path
HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL=30000           # ms - keep connection alive
AUTH_TOKEN=                        # See Security section below
```

#### Security: AUTH_TOKEN Configuration

**When using SSE mode with remote access (e.g., via ngrok for Poke.com), you MUST set an AUTH_TOKEN to prevent unauthorized access to your Hevy data.**

Generate a secure token using either method:

**Option 1: Using the built-in script**
```bash
npm run generate-token
```

**Option 2: Using OpenSSL**
```bash
openssl rand -hex 32
```

Then add the generated token to your `.env` file:
```bash
AUTH_TOKEN=your_generated_token_here
```

When connecting from Poke.com, include the token in the Authorization header:
```
Authorization: Bearer your_generated_token_here
```

**Security Notes:**
- ✅ **REQUIRED** for SSE mode with public/ngrok access
- ❌ **Optional** for stdio mode (Claude Desktop)
- ❌ **Optional** for SSE mode on localhost only
- ⚠️  Never commit your `.env` file or share your AUTH_TOKEN

### 3. Build the Project

```bash
npm run build
```

## Usage

### For Claude Desktop (stdio mode)

#### 1. Run the server in development mode:

```bash
npm run dev
```

#### 2. Configure Claude Desktop

Edit your Claude Desktop config file:
- **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
- **Windows**: `%APPDATA%\Claude
